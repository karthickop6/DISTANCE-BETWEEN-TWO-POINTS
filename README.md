# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
import maths
### Step 2: 
type the values of the given matrix
### Step 3: 
use math.sqrt for to get the distance between two points
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](./formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
use print function and run the program

### PROGRAM:

import math
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
distance=math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))

```
